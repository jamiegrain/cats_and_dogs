# Cats and Dogs image classifier
Building an image classifier based on a CNN


This repo contains the key files used to create an image classifier for classifying images of cats and dogs. The images themselves are omitted due to their size, but the image set used was from a previous kaggle competition. This was my first experience getting to grips with convolutional networks. I would have like to have tried more permutations of number of layers, number of nodes, number of dense layers, etc. but I was restricted by the absence of a GPU.
